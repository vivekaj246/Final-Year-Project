I created App using tkinter, Here I created a dump file of SVM trained model on Images.
Then just i read that model and used it as a classifier. I used python version 3.6.9.
GUI is simple & sweet.
**Installation**
pip install -r requirements.txt in your cmd
Run `rice_disease_pred_GUI.py`, upload images from rice dataset.
You will get the prediction.
